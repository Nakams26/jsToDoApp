//Pseudo code


//1 Save the value
//Let's query the dom the form element and save it as a variable
// Let's query the dom for the input



//2 Attach a submit event listener to the form element
 //Pass in 2 argument the event listener method
   //a) the event you are listing for
   //b)The callback fucntion which will hold the logic we wish to run once the event is heard (AKA occurs on the page)

//Save the text value from the input within a variable

   //  if the user submit an item (check wether the value of the input is not empty), then do some thing:
      // Create a li element
        // a font awesome to it
        // add the text from the item to the li
        
        //Append the li element to the ul element 
   //    else alert the user to submit a valid data
